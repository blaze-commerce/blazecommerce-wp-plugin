# ðŸ”§ Auto-Approval Fix Test

This file is created to test the auto-approval workflow fix.

## Issue Identified
- Workflow run 16276160042 was SKIPPED even though Claude posted APPROVED
- Root cause: Workflow `if` condition was too restrictive
- Timeline analysis showed 3-second delay between Claude comment and workflow trigger

## Fix Applied
1. Enhanced workflow condition to be more robust
2. Added detailed logging for debugging
3. Improved condition checking logic

## Expected Behavior
- Claude should review this PR and post "FINAL VERDICT: APPROVED"
- Auto-approval workflow should trigger and NOT be skipped
- Bot should create approval review
