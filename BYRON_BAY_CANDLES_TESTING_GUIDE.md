# Byron Bay Candles - Testing Guide for BlazeCommerce Plugin Fixes

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step testing procedures to validate that all Byron Bay Candles issues have been resolved by the comprehensive BlazeCommerce plugin fixes.

## Issues Addressed

### ✅ Issue 1: HTTP 400 Redeploy Errors
**Problem**: Silent failures and HTTP 400 errors when clicking "Redeploy Store Front" button
**Solution**: Enhanced error handling with detailed user feedback

### ✅ Issue 2: Individual Sync Operations Returning 0 Documents
**Problem**: Product and Taxonomy sync operations appearing successful but syncing 0 documents
**Solution**: Standardized JSON response format with accurate document counting

### ✅ Issue 3: Silent Sync Failures
**Problem**: Sync operations failing silently without user feedback
**Solution**: Comprehensive error handling and user-friendly error messages

## Testing Procedures

### 1. Test Enhanced Redeploy Functionality

#### 1.1 Test Successful Redeploy
```bash
# Steps:
1. Navigate to BlazeCommerce settings in WordPress admin
2. Click "Redeploy Store Front" button
3. Observe the enhanced progress indicators
4. Verify deployment status checking with attempt counters
5. Confirm successful deployment message with timing information

# Expected Results:
✅ Clear progress indicators during deployment
✅ Deployment ID tracking (if using Vercel API)
✅ Success message with deployment time
✅ No silent failures or hanging operations
```

#### 1.2 Test Error Handling
```bash
# Steps:
1. Temporarily disable internet connection or use invalid credentials
2. Click "Redeploy Store Front" button
3. Observe error handling behavior

# Expected Results:
✅ Clear error messages instead of silent failures
✅ Specific error details (network, authentication, timeout)
✅ No HTTP 400 errors without explanation
✅ User-friendly error descriptions
```

### 2. Test Individual Sync Operations

#### 2.1 Test Product Sync
```bash

✅ Accurate document count display (e.g., "150/150 items")
✅ No false "0 documents" reports
✅ Clear success/failure status
✅ Proper pagination handling for large product sets
```

#### 2.2 Test Taxonomy Sync

1. Click "Sync Taxonomy" button
2. Observe the sync process and results

# Expected Results:
✅ Accurate taxonomy count (e.g., "25/25 items")
✅ Proper category and tag synchronization
✅ Clear completion status
```

#### 2.3 Test SiteInfo and Menu Sync
```bash
# Steps:
1. Click "Sync Site Info" button
2. Click "Sync Menu" button
3. Verify both operations complete successfully

# Expected Results:
✅ JSON response format instead of plain text
✅ Document count reporting (e.g., "1/1 items" for site info)
✅ Clear success messages
✅ No silent failures
```

#### 2.4 Test Page Sync
```bash
# Steps:
1. Click "Sync Pages" button
2. Monitor the sync process

# Expected Results:
✅ Accurate page count reporting
✅ Proper pagination for large page sets
✅ Standardized response format
```

### 3. Test Vercel API Integration (Optional)

#### 3.1 Configure Direct Vercel API
```bash
# Steps:
1. Navigate to BlazeCommerce settings
2. Find "Vercel Deployment Settings" section
3. Enable "Direct Vercel Deployment"
4. Enter Vercel Deployment Token (encrypted storage)
5. Enter Vercel Project ID
6. Enter Vercel Team ID (if applicable)
7. Save settings

# Expected Results:
✅ Settings save successfully
✅ Token is encrypted and not visible in frontend
✅ Input validation works for Project/Team IDs
```

#### 3.2 Test Direct Vercel Deployment
```bash
# Steps:
1. With Vercel API configured, click "Redeploy Store Front"
2. Monitor the deployment process

# Expected Results:
✅ Direct API call to Vercel instead of middleware
✅ Deployment ID tracking
✅ Progress indicators with Vercel-specific status
✅ Successful deployment confirmation
```

### 4. Test Error Scenarios

#### 4.1 Test Network Issues
```bash
# Steps:
1. Temporarily block network access
2. Attempt redeploy and sync operations

# Expected Results:
✅ Clear "Network error" messages
✅ No hanging operations (30-second timeout)
✅ User-friendly error descriptions
```

#### 4.2 Test Invalid Credentials
```bash
# Steps:
1. Use invalid Vercel token or incorrect settings
2. Attempt deployment

# Expected Results:
✅ "Authentication failed" error messages
✅ Specific error details for troubleshooting
✅ No silent failures
```

### 5. Test Backward Compatibility

#### 5.1 Verify Existing Functionality
```bash
# Steps:
1. Test all existing BlazeCommerce features
2. Verify Typesense search functionality
3. Check product data synchronization
4. Test existing middleware deployment

# Expected Results:
✅ All existing features work unchanged
✅ No breaking changes to current workflows
✅ Settings preserved during upgrade
✅ API compatibility maintained
```
