# WordPress & WooCommerce Guidelines

## Workflow & Architecture
- User's workflow involves WordPress/WooCommerce backend with block editor content synced to Typesense and rendered in Next.js frontend
- Max Mega Menu styling configured via attributes in WordPress block editor, including both active background and text color attributes

## Plugin Development
- When modifying BlazeCommerce WordPress plugin files, run build process in plugin's blocks directory after changes
- Prefer implementing plugin fixes in child themes instead of modifying plugin files directly

## Site Configuration
- For dancewear-bc-v3 site, the active theme is blazecommerce-child-main (BC Child), not the Porselli theme

## GridPane Environment
- In Gridpane environments, WP CLI commands use format 'gp wp site-name.domain command' with wp-config.php outside htdocs directory
- Gridpane SSH server IP address is 45.77.228.92 for accessing the live site infrastructure
- Require strict read-only access when checking SSH servers - no modifications or commands that change anything should be executed

## Email Configuration
- Prefer using GridPane's built-in SendGrid email service instead of WP Mail SMTP plugin for live sites
- For BlazeCommerce/dancewear projects, use orders@dancewear.co.uk for WooCommerce order emails and no-reply@dancewear.co.uk for non-order emails

## WooCommerce Specifics
- In WooCommerce, product code is different from SKU - they are separate fields that should be handled distinctly in search functionality
- Prefer to check WooCommerce tax settings on SSH server before implementing cart/tax-related fixes to understand backend configuration
- Prefer to avoid WooCommerce tax setting changes that might cause checkout problems
- Tax should be included in product prices for headless BlazeCommerce implementations, contrasting with previous non-headless setup behavior
