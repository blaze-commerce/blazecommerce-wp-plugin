# Documentation images - exclude from Git tracking
# Images in docs directory should be managed separately to reduce repository size
#
# Recommended alternatives for documentation images:
# - External hosting: GitHub Pages, CDN, or cloud storage services
# - Documentation platforms: GitBook, Notion, or similar platforms
# - Asset repositories: Separate dedicated repositories for media assets
# - Local development: Images can still be used locally for development
#
# Migration strategy for existing large images:
# - Consider moving existing large images to external hosting
# - Update documentation links to reference external URLs
# - Use image optimization tools to reduce file sizes where possible
