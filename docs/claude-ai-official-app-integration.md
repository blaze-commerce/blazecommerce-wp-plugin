# Claude AI Official GitHub App Integration

## üöÄ **New Architecture Overview**

This document describes the updated Claude AI PR Review workflow that integrates with the **official Claude GitHub App** while maintaining the `@blazecommerce-claude-ai` bot's approval gate functionality.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Workflow Architecture**

### **Priority 1: Claude AI Code Review Trigger**
**File**: `.github/workflows/claude-pr-review.yml`
**Purpose**: Trigger the official Claude GitHub App to review PRs

#### **Key Changes**:
- ‚úÖ **Simplified Trigger**: No longer performs AI review directly
- ‚úÖ **Official App Integration**: Posts `@claude` mention to trigger official Claude GitHub App
- ‚úÖ **Repository-Specific Prompts**: Provides detailed review criteria for WordPress plugin development
- ‚úÖ **Clean Architecture**: Focused solely on triggering the official Claude App

#### **Workflow Steps**:
1. **Trigger Detection**: Detects PR events and push events to PR branches
2. **PR Number Resolution**: Finds associated PR for push events
3. **Organization Validation**: Ensures workflow runs only for blaze-commerce organization
4. **Claude App Trigger**: Posts comprehensive review request mentioning `@claude`
5. **Completion Summary**: Provides clear next steps and status

### **Priority 2: Claude AI Approval Gate**
**File**: `.github/workflows/claude-approval-gate.yml`
**Purpose**: Evaluate Claude's feedback and provide `@blazecommerce-claude-ai` approval

#### **Key Changes**:
- ‚úÖ **Official App Detection**: Looks for reviews from `claude[bot]` or `claude`
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED Issues Analysis**: Analyzes Claude's feedback for blocking issues
- ‚úÖ **Auto-Approval Logic**: `@blazecommerce-claude-ai` approves when no REQUIRED issues found
- ‚úÖ **Blocking Logic**: Prevents approval when REQUIRED issues are present

#### **Workflow Jobs**:
1. **Check Trigger**: Determines if workflow should run
2. **Wait for Claude Review**: Waits for Priority 1 completion
3. **Claude Approval Gate**: Updates merge protection status
4. **@blazecommerce-claude-ai Approval**: Implements auto-approval logic

## üîÑ **Complete Workflow Flow**

### **Step 1: PR Creation/Update**
```yaml
Event: pull_request (opened, synchronize, reopened)
Trigger: Priority 1 workflow activates
```

### **Step 2: Claude App Trigger**
```yaml
Action: Priority 1 posts @claude mention with detailed review criteria
Content: WordPress plugin specific review requirements
Result: Official Claude GitHub App begins analysis
```

### **Step 3: Claude App Review**
```yaml
Performer: Official Claude GitHub App (claude[bot])
Analysis: Comprehensive code review with categorized feedback
Output: Comment with CRITICAL: REQUIRED, WARNING: IMPORTANT, INFO: SUGGESTIONS
```

### **Step 4: Approval Gate Evaluation**
```yaml
Trigger: Priority 2 workflow activates after Priority 1 completion
Analysis: Checks Claude's feedback for REQUIRED issues
Decision: Determines if auto-approval is appropriate
```
