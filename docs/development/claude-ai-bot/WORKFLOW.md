# ðŸ”„ BlazeCommerce Claude AI Review Bot - Complete Workflow

This document provides a detailed overview of the complete workflow with visual diagrams and step-by-step processes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Workflow Overview

The BlazeCommerce Claude AI Review Bot operates through three main phases:

1. **Initial Review Process** - Triggered when PRs are opened or updated
2. **Continuous Verification** - Monitors implementation of recommendations
3. **Auto-Approval Process** - Automatically approves when criteria are met

## ðŸ“Š Phase 1: Initial Review Process

### Trigger Events
- Pull request opened
- Pull request synchronized (new commits)
- Pull request reopened

### Workflow Steps

```

### Detailed Step Breakdown

#### 1. Organization Validation
```yaml
Purpose: Ensure bot only operates on BlazeCommerce repositories
Validation: github.repository_owner == "blaze-commerce"
Failure Action: Exit workflow immediately
```

#### 2. Service Health Check
```yaml
GitHub API: Check rate limits and connectivity
Anthropic API: Verify service availability
Circuit Breakers: Check if any services are temporarily disabled
Degraded Mode: Continue with limited functionality if needed
```

#### 3. Repository Setup
```yaml
Checkout: Full repository with history (fetch-depth: 0)
Environment: Install Node.js dependencies (axios, @octokit/rest)
Scripts: Ensure verification and tracking scripts are available
```

#### 4. PR Information Gathering
```yaml
PR Details: Title, body, author, base/head branches
Changed Files: List of modified files with patches
File Analysis: Count, types, and change patterns
Existing Reviews: Previous Claude AI comments
```

#### 5. Repository-Specific Context
```yaml
Frontend (Next.js): React, TypeScript, performance focus
WordPress Plugin: Security, WooCommerce, database optimization
Child Theme: Design, accessibility, responsive patterns
```

#### 6. Claude AI Analysis
```yaml
Model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
Max Tokens: 4000
Timeout: 60 seconds per attempt
Retry Logic: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
```

#### 7. Response Processing
```yaml
Categorization: REQUIRED (ðŸ”´), IMPORTANT (ðŸŸ¡), SUGGESTION (ðŸ”µ)
Formatting: Markdown with clear action items
Tracking: Initialize recommendation tracking system
```

### Performance Targets
- **Expected Time**: 2-3 minutes
- **Maximum Time**: 15 minutes (hard timeout)
- **Success Rate**: > 95%
- **Retry Attempts**: Up to 3 with exponential backoff

## ðŸ“Š Phase 2: Continuous Verification

### Trigger Events

    S --> T[Post Verification Comment]
    T --> U[End - Updated]
    F --> V[End - Service Error]
    R --> W[End - Error Handled]
```

### Verification Engine Process

#### 1. Recommendation Parsing
```yaml
Extract: Parse REQUIRED, IMPORTANT, SUGGESTION items
Categorize: Organize by priority and type
Track: Maintain unique IDs for each recommendation
```

#### 2. File Change Analysis
```yaml
Relevance Scoring: Calculate file-to-recommendation relevance
Content Matching: Analyze code changes for implementation evidence
Confidence Calculation: Determine implementation confidence (0-100%)
```

#### 3. Status Updates
```yaml
Addressed: Confidence >= 70%
Partial: Confidence 40-69%
Pending: Confidence < 40%
Verified: Manual or high-confidence confirmation
```

#### 4. Tracking File Updates
```yaml
Markdown Format: Human-readable progress tracking
JSON State: Machine-readable state management
History: Complete audit trail of changes
```

### Performance Targets
- **Expected Time**: 1-2 minutes
- **Maximum Time**: 10 minutes (hard timeout)
- **Accuracy**: > 70% confidence threshold
- **Update Frequency**: On every commit

## ðŸ“Š Phase 3: Auto-Approval Process

### Trigger Events
- GitHub Actions workflow completion
- All checks passing status

### Workflow Steps

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Workflow Completed] --> B[Find Associated PR]
    B --> C{PR Found?}
    C -->|No| Z[Exit - No PR]
    C -->|Yes| D[Get Check Runs with Retry]
    D --> E{API Success?}
    E -->|No| F[Post API Error]
    E -->|Yes| G{All Checks Passed?}
    G -->|No| Z2[Exit - Checks Failed]
    G -->|Yes| H[Read Tracking File with Retry]
    H --> I{File Read Success?}
    I -->|No| J[Fallback to Review Parsing]
    I -->|Yes| K[Parse Recommendation Status]
    J --> K
    K --> L{Required Addressed?}
    L -->|No| Z3[Exit - Required Pending]
    L -->|Yes| M{Important Addressed?}
    M -->|No| Z4[Exit - Important Pending]
    M -->|Yes| N[Generate Approval with Retry]
    N --> O{Approval Success?}
    O -->|Yes| P[Log Success]
    O -->|No| Q[Post Approval Error]
    P --> R[End - Approved]
    F --> S[End - API Error]
    Q --> T[End - Approval Failed]
```

### Auto-Approval Criteria

**IMPORTANT**: Auto-approval now requires **ALL** conditions to be met (AND logic, not OR).

#### 1. Technical Requirements
```yaml
GitHub Actions: All workflows must pass
Check Runs: No failed checks
Build Status: Successful compilation/build
Test Results: All tests passing
```

#### 2. Claude Review Requirements (MANDATORY)
```yaml
Claude Review Status: Must complete successfully
Claude Authentication: Must use official Anthropic action
Review Comments: Must be posted successfully
```

#### 3. Recommendation Requirements (MANDATORY)
```yaml
REQUIRED Items: ALL must be addressed (no exceptions)
IMPORTANT Items: ALL must be addressed (no exceptions)
SUGGESTION Items: Optional (not required for approval)
Parsing Method: Direct comment parsing OR tracking file
```

#### 4. Approval Revocation Protection (NEW)
```yaml
Previous Approval Status: No recent revocation due to new critical issues
New Commit Analysis: Latest commits must not introduce REQUIRED/IMPORTANT issues
Revocation Check: System automatically revokes approval if new critical issues found
Security Gate: Prevents merge of previously-approved code with new vulnerabilities
```

#### 4. Quality Gates
```yaml
Code Coverage: Maintained or improved (if configured)
Security Scans: No new vulnerabilities
Performance: No significant regressions
Documentation: Updated as needed
```

#### 5. Logic Changes (Fixed Bugs)
```yaml
Previous Logic: Claude Success OR Tracking Complete OR Recommendations Addressed
Current Logic: Claude Success AND All REQUIRED Addressed AND All IMPORTANT Addressed
Tracking File: Optional (will parse Claude comments if missing)
Bypass Logic: Removed (no more auto-approval without recommendation checking)
```

#### 6. Approval Revocation System (NEW SECURITY FEATURE)
```yaml
Revocation Trigger: New commits introducing REQUIRED or IMPORTANT recommendations
Revocation Action: Automatic REQUEST_CHANGES review creation
Revocation Prevention: Blocks auto-approval until new issues are resolved
Security Benefit: Prevents merge of previously-approved code with new vulnerabilities
Audit Trail: Comprehensive logging of all revocation decisions
```

### Performance Targets
- **Expected Time**: < 1 minute
- **Maximum Time**: 5 minutes (hard timeout)
- **Accuracy**: 100% (only approve when criteria truly met)
- **False Positives**: < 1%

## ðŸ”„ Error Handling and Recovery

### Error Types and Responses

#### 1. Service Unavailable
```yaml
Anthropic API: Retry with exponential backoff
GitHub API: Rate limit handling and retry
Network Issues: Temporary retry with jitter
