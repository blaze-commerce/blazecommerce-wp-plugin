# Version Workflow Fixes - July 2025

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive fixes applied to the auto-versioning and release workflows in the BlazeCommerce WordPress Plugin repository. These fixes address critical issues that were preventing successful version bumps and GitHub releases.

## Issues Identified

### Auto-Version Workflow Problems

1. **Git Configuration Issues**
   - **Problem**: Using incorrect email format `action@github.com`
   - **Impact**: Commits were failing due to improper Git identity
   - **Root Cause**: GitHub Actions requires specific bot identity format

2. **Token Permission Issues**
   - **Problem**: Missing `actions: read` permission
   - **Impact**: Workflow couldn't access necessary GitHub Actions context
   - **Root Cause**: Insufficient permissions in workflow definition

3. **Commit Process Failures**
   - **Problem**: No error handling or debugging for commit failures
   - **Impact**: Silent failures with no troubleshooting information
   - **Root Cause**: Lack of validation and error reporting

### Release Workflow Problems

1. **Missing Permissions**
   - **Problem**: Jobs lacked proper permissions for GitHub API access
   - **Impact**: Release creation consistently failed
   - **Root Cause**: GitHub's security model requires explicit permissions

2. **Token Handling Issues**
   - **Problem**: Hard-coded token reference without fallback
   - **Impact**: Workflow failed if custom token wasn't available
   - **Root Cause**: No fallback to default GitHub token

3. **Release Verification Missing**
   - **Problem**: No verification that release was actually created
   - **Impact**: Silent failures in release creation process
   - **Root Cause**: Lack of post-creation validation

## Fixes Implemented

### Auto-Version Workflow Fixes

#### 1. Git Configuration Fix
```yaml
- name: Configure Git
  if: steps.check_files.outputs.should_bump_version == 'true'
  run: |
    git config --local user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
    git config --local user.name "github-actions[bot]"
    echo "‚úÖ Git configured for automated commits"
```

**Benefits**:
- Uses official GitHub Actions bot identity
- Follows GitHub's recommended practices
- Ensures commits are properly attributed

#### 2. Enhanced Permissions
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: read
  actions: read  # Added for better workflow access
```

**Benefits**:
- Provides necessary access to GitHub Actions context
- Enables proper workflow execution
- Maintains security with minimal required permissions

#### 3. Improved Token Handling
```yaml
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.BC_GITHUB_TOKEN || github.token }}
    fetch-depth: 0
```

**Benefits**:
- Fallback to default token if custom token unavailable
- More resilient workflow execution
- Better compatibility across different repository configurations

#### 4. Enhanced Commit Process
```yaml
- name: Commit version bump
  if: steps.check_files.outputs.should_bump_version == 'true' && steps.bump_type.outputs.BUMP_TYPE != 'none'
  run: |
    VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
    echo "üìù Committing version bump to $VERSION..."

    # Debug git status
    echo "üîç Git status before commit:"
    git status --porcelain

    # Add all changes
    git add .
    
    # Verify there are changes to commit
    if git diff --cached --quiet; then
      echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  No changes to commit after git add"
      git status
      exit 1
    fi

    # Create commit with detailed message
    git commit -m "chore(release): bump version to $VERSION [skip ci]

    ü§ñ Automated version bump
    üì¶ Version: $VERSION
    üîÑ Bump type: ${{ steps.bump_type.outputs.BUMP_TYPE }}
    üìù Updated files: package.json, blaze-wooless.php, blocks/package.json, CHANGELOG.md"

    # Verify commit was created
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "‚ùå Failed to create commit"
      echo "üîç Git status after failed commit:"
      git status
      exit 1
    fi

    echo "‚úÖ Commit created successfully"
    echo "üîç Latest commit:"
    git log --oneline -1

    echo "üöÄ Pushing changes..."
    if ! git push; then
      echo "‚ùå Failed to push changes"
      echo "üîç Git remote info:"
      git remote -v
      echo "üîç Current branch:"
      git branch --show-current
      exit 1
    fi

    echo "‚úÖ Version bump completed and pushed successfully!"
```

**Benefits**:
- Comprehensive error handling and debugging
- Step-by-step validation of commit process
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting failures
- Verification of successful push operations

### Release Workflow Fixes

#### 1. Job-Level Permissions
```yaml
validate-release:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  permissions:
    contents: read
    actions: read
  # ... rest of job

build-and-release:
  needs: validate-release
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: needs.validate-release.outputs.should_create_release == 'true'
  permissions:
    contents: write
    actions: read
  # ... rest of job

workflow-summary:
  needs: validate-release
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: always()
  permissions:
    contents: read
  # ... rest of job
```

**Benefits**:
- Explicit permissions for each job's requirements
- Follows principle of least privilege
- Enables proper GitHub API access

#### 2. Enhanced Release Creation
```yaml
- name: Create GitHub Release
  id: create_release
  uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
  with:
    tag_name: ${{ github.ref_name }}
    name: "üöÄ Release ${{ needs.validate-release.outputs.version }}"
    body: ${{ steps.release_notes.outputs.RELEASE_NOTES }}
    files: |
      blazecommerce-wp-plugin-${{ needs.validate-release.outputs.version }}.zip
    draft: false
    prerelease: ${{ needs.validate-release.outputs.is-prerelease == 'true' }}
    generate_release_notes: true
    fail_on_unmatched_files: true  # Added for better error detection
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.BC_GITHUB_TOKEN || github.token }}

- name: Verify release creation
  run: |
    VERSION="${{ needs.validate-release.outputs.version }}"
    RELEASE_URL="${{ steps.create_release.outputs.url }}"
    
    if [ -z "$RELEASE_URL" ]; then
      echo "‚ùå Release URL is empty - release creation may have failed"
      exit 1
    fi
    
    echo "‚úÖ Release created successfully!"
    echo "üîó Release URL: $RELEASE_URL"
    echo "üì¶ Version: $VERSION"
```

**Benefits**:
- Better error detection with `fail_on_unmatched_files`
- Token fallback for improved reliability
- Post-creation verification to ensure success
- Detailed logging of release information

## Testing Instructions

### Testing Auto-Version Workflow

1. **Create a test commit with conventional format**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "fix: test auto-version workflow fixes"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor the workflow**:
   - Go to GitHub Actions tab
   - Watch the "Auto Version Bump" workflow
   - Verify it completes successfully
   - Check that version was bumped in package.json

3. **Verify commit was created**:
   - Check git history for automated commit
   - Verify commit message format
   - Confirm version files were updated

### Testing Release Workflow

1. **Create a version tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.13.0
   git push origin v1.13.0
   ```

2. **Monitor the workflow**:
   - Go to GitHub Actions tab
   - Watch the "Create Release" workflow
   - Verify it completes successfully

3. **Verify release was created**:
   - Go to GitHub Releases page
   - Confirm new release exists
   - Check that ZIP file was attached
   - Verify release notes were generated

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing these fixes:

1. **Auto-Version Workflow**:
   - ‚úÖ Commits will be created with proper Git identity
   - ‚úÖ Version bumps will complete successfully
   - ‚úÖ Detailed error messages for any failures
   - ‚úÖ Reliable push operations to main branch

2. **Release Workflow**:
   - ‚úÖ GitHub releases will be created successfully
   - ‚úÖ ZIP files will be properly attached
   - ‚úÖ Release notes will be generated
   - ‚úÖ Pre-release detection will work correctly

3. **Overall Improvements**:
   - ‚úÖ Reduced workflow failures
   - ‚úÖ Better debugging capabilities
   - ‚úÖ More reliable automation
   - ‚úÖ Improved error reporting

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Checks

1. **Weekly**: Review workflow run history for any failures
2. **Monthly**: Verify version consistency across all files
3. **Quarterly**: Update workflow dependencies and actions

### Troubleshooting

If workflows still fail after these fixes:

1. **Check branch protection rules** - ensure GitHub Actions can push
2. **Verify token permissions** - confirm BC_GITHUB_TOKEN has necessary scopes
3. **Review file changes** - ensure version scripts are working correctly
4. **Check dependencies** - verify all npm packages are installed
