## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Claude Doesn't Respond**

#### **Check API Key Configuration**
1. Go to Repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and Variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is configured
3. Ensure the key is valid and has proper permissions

#### **Check Workflow Execution**
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Look for "üí¨ Claude Interactive Assistant" workflow
3. Check if workflow was triggered by your comment
4. Review workflow logs for any errors

#### **Common Issues**

**API Key Not Found**
```
‚ùå ERROR: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret is not configured
```
**Solution**: Configure the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret in repository settings

**Permission Denied**
```
Error: Resource not accessible by integration
```
**Solution**: Verify workflow has `pull-requests: write` and `issues: write` permissions

**Rate Limiting**
```
Error: Rate limit exceeded
```
**Solution**: Wait a few minutes before making another request

### **Workflow Not Triggering**

#### **Verify Trigger Conditions**
- Ensure you're using `@claude` (case-sensitive)
- Check that the comment is in a supported location (PR, issue, review)
- Verify the workflow file is in the correct branch
