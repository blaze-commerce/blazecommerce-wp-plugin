# GitHub Actions SVN Dependency Fix - PR #337

## Summary

Fixed critical GitHub Actions workflow failure in PR #337 where the WordPress test environment setup was failing due to missing SVN (Subversion) dependency. The `bin/install-wp-tests.sh` script requires SVN to download WordPress test files from the WordPress.org SVN repository, but SVN was not installed on GitHub Actions Ubuntu runners.

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause
The `install-wp-tests.sh` script uses SVN commands on lines 106-107:
```bash
svn co --quiet https://develop.svn.wordpress.org/${WP_TESTS_TAG}/tests/phpunit/includes/ $WP_TESTS_DIR/includes
svn co --quiet https://develop.svn.wordpress.org/${WP_TESTS_TAG}/tests/phpunit/data/ $WP_TESTS_DIR/data
```

However, the GitHub Actions workflow did not install SVN before running this script, causing the failure:
```
svn: command not found
```

### Impact
- All test workflows failing for PR #337
- Unable to run PHPUnit tests
- Blocking PR merge and development workflow
- Affecting multiple PHP/WordPress version combinations in test matrix

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Workflow Enhancements (.github/workflows/tests.yml)

#### Added System Dependencies Installation
```yaml
- name: Install system dependencies
  run: |
    echo "DEBUG: Installing system dependencies for WordPress testing..."
    
    # Update package list
    sudo apt-get update -qq
    
    # Install Subversion (required by install-wp-tests.sh)
    echo "INSTALLING: Subversion (SVN)..."
    sudo apt-get install -y subversion
    
    # Verify SVN installation
    if ! command -v svn &> /dev/null; then
      echo "ERROR: SVN installation failed - svn command not found"
      exit 1
    fi
    echo "SUCCESS: SVN installed successfully - $(svn --version --quiet)"
    
    # Verify other required tools are available
    echo "VERIFYING: Checking other required dependencies..."
    # ... comprehensive dependency verification
```

#### Enhanced WordPress Test Environment Setup
- Added MySQL readiness checks with 30-second timeout
- Improved error handling with detailed debugging information
- Added SVN connectivity validation
- Enhanced error messages with troubleshooting hints

#### Updated Test Coverage Job
- Added MySQL service configuration (was missing)
- Added system dependencies installation
- Improved error handling consistency

### 2. Script Improvements (bin/install-wp-tests.sh)

#### Added Comprehensive Dependency Checking
```bash
# Function to check if a command exists
command_exists() {
    command -v "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1
}

# Function to check dependencies
check_dependencies() {
    echo "CHECKING: Verifying required dependencies..."
    
    local missing_deps=()
    
    # Check for SVN (Subversion) - Critical dependency
    if ! command_exists svn; then
        missing_deps+=("subversion")
        echo "ERROR: SVN (Subversion) is required but not installed"
    else
        echo "SUCCESS: SVN found - $(svn --version --quiet)"
    fi
    
    # ... check all other dependencies
}
```

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- Improved download function with comprehensive error checking
- Added detailed error messages for SVN operations
- Enhanced network connectivity validation
- Better file verification and error reporting

#### Added Installation Instructions
- Automatic detection of missing dependencies
- Platform-specific installation commands
- Clear error messages with actionable solutions

### 3. Documentation
