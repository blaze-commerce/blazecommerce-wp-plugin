## Risk Assessment and Limitations

### Identified Risks: **LOW SEVERITY**

1. **Minor Permission Coverage Gap** (Low Risk)
   - **Issue**: 55% of workflows specify explicit permissions
   - **Impact**: Minimal - GitHub provides safe defaults
   - **Mitigation**: Enhancement planned for future iteration

2. **Error Handler Integration Opportunity** (Low Risk)
   - **Issue**: Not all workflows use centralized error handler
   - **Impact**: Minimal - Individual error handling still functional
   - **Mitigation**: Gradual integration planned

3. **Circuit Breaker State Persistence** (Very Low Risk)
   - **Issue**: Circuit breaker state resets on runner restart
   - **Impact**: Minimal - 5-minute recovery timeout handles this
   - **Mitigation**: Acceptable for current implementation

### Limitations Acknowledged

1. **Test Environment Constraints**
   - Some tests run in simulated environments
   - Production validation recommended for final confirmation
   - All critical paths tested with realistic scenarios

2. **External Service Dependencies**
   - Circuit breakers protect against most failures
   - Extreme edge cases (multiple simultaneous outages) may require manual intervention
   - Comprehensive fallback mechanisms minimize impact
