# Typesense PHP Client

Official PHP client for the Typesense API: https://github.com/typesense/typesense

## Installation

```
$ composer require php-http/curl-client typesense/typesense-php
```

You can also add `typesense/typesense-php` to your project's `composer.json`.

Typesense uses [HTTPlug](http://httplug.io/) as an abstraction layer for an HTTP client. You'll find the List of supported HTTP clients & adapters [here](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/clients.html). Please be sure to install a supported client.

## Credits

This client was originally developed by [Abdullah Al-Faqeir](https://github.org/abdullahfaqeir) from 
[DevLoops](https://github.com/devloopsnet) and was 
[adopted](https://github.com/devloopsnet/typesense-php/issues/4) as the official PHP client library for Typesense in Oct 2020.

Ongoing development and support is now provided by Typesense, in addition to our collaborators.
