name: Auto Version Bump (DISABLED)

# This workflow has been replaced by the PR-based version preparation workflow
# It is disabled to prevent conflicts with the new approach

# The new workflow files are:
# - .github/workflows/pr-version-prep.yml (prepares versions in PRs)
# - .github/workflows/main-tag-creation.yml (creates tags after PR merge)
# - .github/workflows/release.yml (creates releases from tags)
