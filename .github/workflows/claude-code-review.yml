# Retry Strategy for API Resilience:
# This workflow implements a robust retry mechanism to handle Anthropic API overload (Error 529).
# - 3 total attempts with exponential backoff: 30s → 60s → 120s
# - Jitter randomization (±25%) prevents thundering herd problems
# - Conditional execution skips unnecessary steps when earlier attempts succeed
# - Comprehensive error handling provides clear guidance when all attempts fail
# - Total maximum runtime: ~4 minutes (appropriate for temporary API overload scenarios)

              The automated code review failed after 3 attempts due to API overload (Error 529). This is a temporary issue with the Anthropic Claude API service.

              **What this means:**
              - Your code changes are not the problem
              - This is a temporary service overload issue
              - The review will be retried automatically on the next commit

              **Next steps:**
              - You can proceed with your development work
              - Consider manually requesting a review with \`@claude\` in a comment if urgent
              - Check [Anthropic Status](https://status.anthropic.com/) for service updates

              **For maintainers:** This failure indicates high API load. Consider implementing additional retry strategies or alternative review methods during peak times.`
