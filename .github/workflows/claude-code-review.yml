            Please review this pull request and provide comprehensive feedback on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns
            - Test coverage

            CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR STATUS DETERMINATION:

            1. **Review Previous Feedback**: If this PR has previous Claude review comments, check if the required changes from those reviews have been properly implemented in the new commits.

            2. **Do NOT mark as APPROVED**: If required changes from previous reviews haven't been implemented, even if the new code looks good in isolation.

            3. **Implementation Verification**: Verify that any CRITICAL or REQUIRED issues from previous reviews have been addressed before considering approval.

            üö® CRITICAL: You must end your review with a standardized verdict section using this EXACT format.

            The automated approval system depends on this specific format. Use EXACTLY this structure:

            ### FINAL VERDICT
            **Status**: APPROVED
            **Merge Readiness**: READY TO MERGE
            **Recommendation**: Brief explanation of your decision

            OR

            ### FINAL VERDICT
            **Status**: CONDITIONAL APPROVAL
            **Merge Readiness**: READY AFTER FIXES
            **Recommendation**: Brief explanation of your decision

            OR

            ### FINAL VERDICT
            **Status**: BLOCKED
            **Merge Readiness**: NOT READY
            **Recommendation**: Brief explanation of your decision

            STATUS GUIDELINES:
            - APPROVED: No critical issues found, all previous required changes implemented, code meets all standards
            - CONDITIONAL APPROVAL: Minor improvements suggested but not blocking, previous required changes addressed
            - BLOCKED: Critical issues that must be fixed before merge, OR required changes from previous reviews not implemented

            ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Use the exact status values (APPROVED, CONDITIONAL APPROVAL, BLOCKED) without brackets or additional formatting. The automated system will detect these specific terms.

            Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.
